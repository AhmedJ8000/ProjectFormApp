        A recently established home maintenance service provider aims to transition its service request procedures to an online platform for enhanced efficiency in service pricing 
        (typically structured around fixed rates for various service types), 
        service options, request management, and client monitoring. 
        Company executives seek to establish and oversee service classifications, 
        administer services, accept client service requests, assign staff to tasks, 
        and monitor their own category. Team members require access to view their assigned service requests, 
        update their statuses, and handle relevant comments and documents associated with requests.
